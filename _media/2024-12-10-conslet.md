WSU and Penn State covered a [Conservation Letters paper](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.13073) by Kris, Anne, and Tanzanian and international collaborators. The coverage highlights the fact that having any friendship with someone in a nearby village makes someone more likely to participate in fisheries management, including reporting violators, cleaning up the beach, and educating others. See here for the releases from [Washington State](https://news.wsu.edu/press-release/2024/12/10/long-distance-friendships-can-provide-conservation-benefits/) and [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/long-distance-friendships-may-provide-conservation-benefits).
