WSU and Penn State covered a [Conservation Letters paper](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.13073) by Kris, Anne, and Tanzanian and international collaborators: Having any friendship with someone in a nearby village makes someone more likely to participate in fisheries management, including reporting violators, cleaning up the beach, and educating others.
