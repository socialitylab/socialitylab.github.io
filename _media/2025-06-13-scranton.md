As a guest opinion columnist for The Times-Tribune, [Anne spoke directly to Pennsylvanians](https://www.thetimes-tribune.com/2025/06/13/federal-science-cuts-threaten-our-natural-resources/), highlighting how federal funding can support stewardship of our rivers and lakes in ways that might surprise people. She also talked about how much US taxpayers stand to lose from the cuts proposed in the One Big Beautiful Bill â€“ not only smart, science-backed stewardship, but our returns on investment.
