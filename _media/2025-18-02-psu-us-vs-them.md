Following release of [her paper with Cody Ross in _Evolutionary Human Sciences_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/perceived-inequality-and-variability-in-the-expression-of-parochial-altruism/B8A882DD29550F523413478D349B20C9), Anne spoke with Penn State science communicator Fracisco Tutella about how us vs them mindsets are common but not inevitable. She identified common ingredients to us vs them thinking, like differential resource access, what other people say, and past experience, and small ways each of us can tackle us vs them behavior through local action.
