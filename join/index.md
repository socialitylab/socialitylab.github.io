The HSL is accepting PhD students at Penn State interested in evolutionary social science or applied evolutionary anthropology with a focus on climate change adaptation, understudied social relationships, or cooperation and natural resource management. Students will join the fully funded PhD program at [Penn State Anthropology](https://anth.la.psu.edu/), with [options to join a dual degree program](https://anth.la.psu.edu/graduate/dual-title-degrees/) like Demography or Transdisciplinary Research on Environment and Society (TREES).

### Training in the HSL emphasizes:
* Integration of theory and methods from across the social, behavioral, and ecological sciences, with evolutionary theory as a throughline
* Research at the interface of basic science and applied work, often in collaboration with communities, industry, nonprofit organizations, and government
* Preparation for research positions in academia, industry, government, and the nonprofit sector
* Field research - explicitly including fieldwork in the US and remote data collection (e.g., Zoom interviews)
* Mixed-method data collection (that is, both quantitative and qualitative methods) analyzed with cutting-edge statistics

### We especially encourage applications from those interested in:
* Research in evolutionary social science and applied evolutionary anthropology
* Climate change adaptation and its effects on health and livelihoods
* Studying understudied social relationships, including long-distance relationships (in the social and behavioral sciences) and nonkin relationships (in evolutionary social science)
* Cooperation, including (but not limited to) collective action, common-pool resource problems, and social safety nets

The HSL is committed to collaborative, ethical, inclusive research and to open science practices. For more about our commitments and priorities, see [our lab manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gsos2uzViR5ekILkxQvUvaB0fb_3TSRP4-_oD94xA8E/).

### International and/or undocumented students are welcome to apply
