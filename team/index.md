<h3 style="text-align: center;">Dr Anne Pisor; HSL director; Penn State</h3>

Anne Pisor ("pie-zur") is an integrative scientific anthropologist who studies how people manage risk. She's an expert on the evolution of cooperation in humans, especially social relationships that span communities ("long-distance relationships") -- often key to risk management. This work inspired her federally funded projects on climate change adaptation (NIH) and natural resource management (NSF), interdisciplinary efforts that involve collaborations in public health, epidemiology, development, climate science, public policy, and more.

Evolutionary social scientists know Anne as a human behavioral ecologist, cultural evolutionist, and evolutionary psychologist; anthropologists know her as a cultural and evolutionary anthropologist; social scientists know her as an anthropologist, demographer, ecologist, and statistician; and those in health science and business know her as an expert in behavior and culture.

Anne is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Anthropology](https://anth.la.psu.edu/) and [Social Science Research Institute](https://ssri.psu.edu/) at Penn State University. She was recently named a Rising Star by [the Human Behavior and Evolution Society](https://www.hbes.com/awards/#toggle-id-1) as an early-career researcher "whose innovative work has already advanced the field." You can [watch a talk of hers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJoGC-J_18w) for a taste of her academic approach.

When not at the university, you can find Anne mentoring entrepreneurs and change-makers, helping them narrow down who they're serving, what's hard for those they serve, and what actions they can take to make things better. See [Anne's LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annepisor/) for more on her cross-sector work.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Dr Kris Smith; HSL co-director; Washington State</h3>

[Kris Smith](https://www.kristophermsmith.com/) is a postdoc in the Human Sociality Lab and director of the [Tanga Sociality and Fisheries Project](https://labs.wsu.edu/tsfp/) in Tanzania. He studies how evolution and culture shape cooperative relationships, and how cooperative relationships can help achieve collective action, such as natural resource management. Prior to joining the Human Sociality Lab, Kris received his PhD in Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania in 2019 and stayed on for a two-year postdoctoral fellowship in the Social and Behavioral Science Initiative. During his time at Penn, he conducted field research with Hadza hunter-gatherers in Tanzania, studying how their decisions of whom to cooperate with are changing with increased integration with their neighbors.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Courtney Elmore; MA student; Penn State</h3>

Courtney is a passionate and driven Master's student in Anthropology who wants to focus on human relationships and social dynamics. A military veteran with extensive experience in diverse and challenging environments, Courtney brings a unique perspective to the study of human interactions and cultural connections. Motivated by a desire to understand how relationships are shaped by societal contexts, Courtney is particularly interested in the intersection of cooperation, identity, and community. Through her studies, Courtney seeks to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications, contributing to a deeper understanding of human relationships in complex and evolving environments.

<img src="/images/evan_leacox.jpg" alt="Evan Leacox" width="200"/>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Evan Leacox; PhD student; Washington State</h3>

Evan’s interested in how adaptive governance emerges from environmental uncertainty, especially (1) what supports and limits diverse social collaboration, and (2) when and why people are patient with the - often slow - process of cultural and institutional change and transformation. He focuses primarily on how people are approaching equitable, community-led Social-Ecological System stewardship networks in the Columbia River Basin. Evan prioritizes a collaborative, community-engaged research approach to support theory development and cultural research that is guided by, and seeks to contribute to applied, community-identified interests. Evan is a trainee in [WSU’s Rivers, Watersheds, and Communities program](https://nrt-rwc.wsu.edu/), where he has an NSF-funded graduate research fellowship.

<img src="/images/ollie_shannon.jpg" alt="Ollie Shannon" width="200"/>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Ollie Shannon; PhD student; Washington State</h3>

Ollie (they/them) is a Ph.D. student at Washington State University, driven by a lifelong commitment to social justice and the empowerment of marginalized communities. With over 20 years of experience as a social justice organizer in Idaho, they have dedicated much of their career to advocating for change and creating spaces for those often excluded from mainstream conversations. After years of direct action, Ollie returned to academia to further their understanding of how systemic structures impact mental health, earning a master’s degree at Boise State University where they focused on the cultural impacts on mental health within the Queer community in the Pacific Northwest.

Currently, Ollie is deeply engaged in research that explores cooperation, resource movement, and mutual support within Queer chosen family networks. Their work centers on understanding how cultural differences within these networks shape and influence the ways in which people come together, support each other, and build lasting, meaningful connections. At the heart of this research is a firm belief in the importance of conducting mutually beneficial research that is ethical, collaborative, and directly contributes to the communities being studied. They are passionate about ensuring that research is not only academic in nature but also rooted in real-world impact that strengthens and uplifts those who have been historically underserved.

Beyond their research, Ollie is enthusiastic about learning and developing innovative teaching strategies, particularly in the realm of equity-based pedagogy. They believe that education has the power to transform individuals and communities, and are committed to creating inclusive, empowering learning environments. Teaching is a deep passion for Ollie—one that aligns with their core belief that knowledge sharing and critical thinking are essential tools in the fight for justice and equality.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Dithapelo Medupe; PhD student; Penn State</h3>

Dithapelo Medupe is from Botswana and did my undergraduate studies at Stanford University on full scholarship followed by medical school in Grenada and London. Ditha worked as a medical doctor in Botswana for five years. She is a fifth year PhD student in Pennsylvania State University working with Mary Shenk, Anne Pisor and Luke Glowacki. Ditha won the HBES New Investigator Award in 2023.

Ditha is interested in the effects of ecology on culture and health and the effects of culture on health. Her first project looked at how the effects of biodiversity on the spread of intensive agriculture since the Neolithic have been underestimated and biodiversity may have prohibited intensive agriculture and it's associated complex stratified societies in many places. She is currently interested in the suites of characteristics that shift with market integration, from behavior to health, and the effects of market integration on causes of morbidity and mortality in areas which didn't have intensive agriculture.
