Funding from NICHD (#P2CHD041025) to Penn State Population Research Institute is funding research on the real-time impacts of heat on health as people move across space. Anne is working with collaborators from WSU Global Health Kenya and University of Nairobi, as well as with Rendille communities, to understand how the range of exposures men face -- as herders travel far from home, stay close to home, or even transition their livelihoods -- translates into acute and longer-term health outcomes. This is part of a larger team effort to measure adaptation efficacy and understand how adaptations trade off with one another -- with how reducing risk in one domain may increase risk in another.
