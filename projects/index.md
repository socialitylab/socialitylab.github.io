The Human Sociality Lab studies how people use social relationships to navigate the impacts of environmental, social, and economic change on their well-being, health, and livelihoods. We approach this problem from multiple perspectives, looking at individual psychology and decision-making, relationship formation and maintenance, the structure of social networks, and the impacts of local institutions.

    <h5 style="text-align: left;">Understudied social relationships</h5>
    Biological kinship, same-community relationships, and antagonistic intergroup relationships have been a throughline of research in the social, behavioral, and evolutionary sciences. In the HSL, we study nonkin relationships, chosen family relationships, and long-distance social relationships – understudied but crucial relationships for navigating environmental, social, and economic change, past and present. See our work on long-distance relationships, the flexibility of parochial altruism, and godparents for recent examples.

    <h5 style="text-align: left;">Climate change adaptation</h5>
   Individuals and households use strategies to reduce the risks of climate impacts – to adapt to them. In the HSL, we study which adaptations are created, modified, shared, and used; the environmental predictors of which adaptations are used; and whether adaptations that reduce risks to livelihood can increase risks to health. For more, see our work on remittances, culture and climate adaptation, and climate change and health in Kenya.

    <h5 style="text-align: left;">Natural resource management</h5>
   Social relationships affect people’s use of natural resources, like fisheries and forests. In the HSL, we ask how long-distance relationships can promote and undercut natural resource management – including whether individuals do their part to preserve fisheries, whether communities work together in management, and whether ideas move from one community to another. For more, see our work with coastal communities in Tanzania.
