Academics talk a lot about sustainability, but not always in ways practitioners can use. How can academics better deliver on their promises of insights?

We spent three days in intensive workshops with folks from NGOs, grassroots organizing, and the business community to understand how cultural evolution researchers can better bridge the research-practice gap.

This paper details what topics emerged and the take-home messages about how academics can get started: Simplify communication and make it clear what your approach or findings bring to the table.
